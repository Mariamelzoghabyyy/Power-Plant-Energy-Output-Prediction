# Power-Plant-Energy-Output-Prediction
This project analyzes and models the energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) using machine learning techniques. It applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and both built-in and custom regression models to predict the plant's electrical output based on environmental conditions.

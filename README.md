âš¡ Power Plant Energy Output Prediction â€“ Regression Analysis in Python

This project analyzes and models the energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) using machine learning techniques. It applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and both built-in and custom regression models to predict the plant's electrical output based on environmental conditions.

ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

Dataset: Utilized the UCI CCPP dataset with features including Temperature, Exhaust Vacuum, Ambient Pressure, and Relative Humidity to predict Energy Output (PE).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and pairplots to identify relationships and trends in the data.

Data Preprocessing: Applied standardization and train-test splitting to prepare the data for supervised learning.

Modeling Approaches:

Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn.

Developed a custom gradient descent algorithm to optimize model parameters manually.

Evaluation Metrics: Measured model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score for both training and testing sets.

Visualization: Plotted predicted vs. actual energy output to assess model fit and diagnose underfitting/overfitting.
